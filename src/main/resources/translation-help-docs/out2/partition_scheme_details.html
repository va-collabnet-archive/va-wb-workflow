  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Workset details - Creation of partition schemes</h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">Worksets may be too large to be delivered to only one translator. Also, depending on each
      translation team workflow, some members of the translation team will translate almost any
      concepts, while others will review already translated concepts or review the source concepts
      appropriateness. Still others may review groups of concepts for establishing editorial
      policies and translation consistency, or there may be a specialized group of translators that
      master the traslation of some specific areas (e.g. odontology concepts, concepts related to
      medicial specialties [e.g. neurosurgery], etc.). Therefore, the project manager must have a
      tool for dividing the worksets of concepts to be translated according to different
      criteria.</p>

    <p class="p"/>

    <p class="p">When workset creation is complete, the project manager may choose to divide it in partitions.
      To do so, he/she should press the 'New partition scheme button' in the workset details
      panel.</p>

    <p class="p"/>

    <p class="p">A partition scheme is a way of dividing the workset. A given workset may be divided in
      several ways for different purposes and each partition criterion will be represented by a
      partition scheme</p>

    <p class="p"/>

    <p class="p"><a name="topic-1__image_ktz_lmm_bg"><!-- --></a><img class="image" id="topic-1__image_ktz_lmm_bg" src="images/partition_scheme_name.PNG"/></p>

    <p class="p"/>

    <p class="p">There cannot be two partitions with the same name. If trying to do so, a warning message will
      appear. However, when a partition scheme has been retired, it will be possible to create a new
      partition scheme using the same name as the one that was retired.</p>

    <p class="p">If there is no need to divide the workset into parts, the project manager may choose to
      create what is known as the 'One click partition'. This partition will have the same number of
      members as the whole workset.</p>

    <p class="p">When the partition scheme has been created, it is displayed in the tree view on the left
      under the Partition Schemes icon: </p>

    </p>

    <p class="p">Its details will be shown in the right panel. Pressing the 'Edit partitions' button in this
      panel will allow the project manager to divide the workset according to specific needs .The
      'Edit partitions' button opens the Refset Partitioner, which will be used to specify
      partitioning criteria (see the help hook in the Partition Scheme details screen).</p>

    <p class="p"/>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Creation of one partition from a whole workset</u></strong></p>

    <p class="p">A single partition from the whole workset may be created by clicking the ‘Create one click
      partition’ button in the Workset details panel. The One click partition will have the same
      number of members as the workset. Opening the ‘Members’ tab in the Partition details pane will
      show the list of members, as well as their number.</p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Partitions tab:</u></strong></p>

    <p class="p">The Partition scheme details panel also shows a 'Partitions' tab that lists the partitions
      created with the selected workset. This tab includes a tool for partition merging (two or more
      partitions may be merged into one), as shown below:</p>
